# The catalog API

The catalog is four static JSON files on GitHub Pages. There's no server, no query
parameters and no authentication: a client downloads the catalog and looks devices up itself.

## Files

Every file is under `https://brandtdaniels.github.io/insteon-device-catalog/v0/` and is fetched
with a plain `GET` over HTTPS.

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `manifest.json` | The catalog's version, when it was built, the number of profiles, the catalog's file name and its SHA-256 |
| `catalog.json` | Every profile sorted by model, and every command set |
| `device-profile.schema.json` | The JSON Schema every profile follows |
| `command-set.schema.json` | The JSON Schema every command set follows |

`manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "built": "2026-10-28T22:00:00Z",

  "devices": [ { "model": "2242", "name": "Hub", "…": "…" }, "…" ]
}
```

## A profile

Bytes are strings of `0x` and two uppercase hexadecimal digits, as Insteon documents write them.

```json
{
  "model": "2852",
  "name": "Leak Sensor",
  "aliases": ["Water Leak Sensor"],
  "description": "Battery-powered sensor that reports when it detects water.",
  "identities": [{ "category": "0x10", "subcategory": "0x08" }],
  "radio": "rf",
  "role": "controller",
  "batteryPowered": true,
  "groups": [
    { "number": "0x01", "name": "Dry", "role": "controller" },
    { "number": "0x02", "name": "Wet", "role": "controller" },
    { "number": "0x04", "name": "Heartbeat", "role": "controller" }
  ],
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "kind": "groupEvents",
      "events": [
        { "group": "0x01", "command1": "0x11", "event": "dry" },
        { "group": "0x02", "command1": "0x11", "event": "wet" }
      ]
    },
    { "kind": "heartbeat", "group": "0x04", "intervalMinutes": 1428 }
  ],
  "sources": ["HouseLinc device catalog", "Leak Sensor Developer Notes"]
}
```

`aliases` and `description` are optional, for showing and searching products: other names a
product is known by, and what it is.

An identity can also carry a `firmware` range, `{ "from": "0x40", "through": "0xFF" }`, when a
product reports the same category and subcategory with different behavior across firmware
versions. Without one, the identity covers every version.

An identity's `productKey`, where a source gives it, is the Insteon Product Key the product
reports in D2 to D4 of the Product Data Response that answers Product Data Request (cmd1 `0x03`,
cmd2 `0x00`), written `0x00001A`, D2 first. `none` means the product reports no key: Insteon's
documents mark it Legacy, made before product keys, and such a product doesn't answer Product
Data Request, so an app shouldn't wait for one. The identity's `verification` covers the key too.

`engines` says which Insteon engine the product runs under each identity, where a source states
it. Each entry names an `engine` (`i1`, `i2`, or `i2cs`, which rejects an extended message whose
D14 checksum is wrong), an identity's `category` and `subcategory`, and optionally a `firmware`
selection: `{ "only": ["0x41", "0xD1"] }` or `{ "except": ["0x22", "0x24"] }`. Without `firmware`,
every version of the identity runs the engine. For example, the 2476D SwitchLinc Dimmer runs
i2CS, and so expects a checksum in D14 of extended messages, only on the firmware versions its
entries list for each subcategory. A firmware version no entry covers runs an engine the
catalog doesn't know; the build makes sure no two entries cover the same one.

The device itself is the surest source: it reports its engine in reply to a get engine version
command (cmd1 `0x0D`). The catalog's entries are for deciding before asking, or for a device
that doesn't answer.

## A product's lifecycle

A profile's `lifecycle` says how to install the product, link it, wake it, reset it and take it
out of service, so an app can guide a person through each, or do the steps it can itself:

```json
"lifecycle": {
  "linking": { "steps": [
    { "text": "Press and hold the SET button until the switch beeps.",
      "action": "hold", "control": "SET button", "expect": "Beep" } ] },
  "reset": { "steps": [
    { "text": "Pull the SET button out from the switch until the status LEDs turn off.",
      "action": "pullTab", "control": "SET button", "expect": "Status LEDs turn off" },
    { "text": "Wait about ten seconds.", "action": "wait", "seconds": 10 },
    { "text": "Push in and hold the SET button until the long beep stops.",
      "action": "hold", "control": "SET button", "expect": "Long beep" },
    { "text": "Release the SET button.", "action": "release", "control": "SET button", "expect": "Double beep" } ] },
  "resetErases": ["links", "settings"]
}
```

- `installation`, `linking`, `multiLinking`, `unlinking`, `waking`, `reset` and `removal` are each
  a procedure: `steps` in order, with `notes` and a `verification` like any other value.
- A procedure's `alternatives` are other whole procedures for the same thing, such as from a Hub
  instead of with the SET button; an app follows one. Each alternative's `description` names it,
  such as From a Hub or Soft factory reset.
- A step's `text` is what a person reads. `action`, `control`, `seconds`, `count` and `expect`
  say the same in a form an app can use: which button to hold and for how long, how many taps,
  and the beep or LED that shows it worked. Each step does one thing; a step that holds a button
  and then releases it is two steps.
- A step's `device` is `this`, the product the profile describes, unless it says `other`: the
  other device being linked or unlinked, such as the responder a controller links to, or the Hub.
  It defaults to `this`.
- A step's `action` is one of:

  | Action | What the step does |
  | --- | --- |
  | `hold` | Press and hold `control`, for `seconds` or until `expect` happens. |
  | `tap` | Press and release `control` quickly, `count` times. |
  | `press` | Press `control` once, as a click rather than a tap or hold; `seconds`, where given, is how long the press lasts. |
  | `release` | Let go of a held `control`. |
  | `turn` | Turn a knob, dial or other control. |
  | `plugIn`, `unplug` | Plug the product in or unplug it. |
  | `powerOff`, `powerOn` | Turn power off or on, at a breaker or switch, or by unscrewing a bulb and screwing it back in. |
  | `wire` | Connect or disconnect wires. |
  | `mount` | Mount or fasten the product or a part of it. |
  | `insertBatteries`, `removeBatteries` | Put batteries in or take them out. |
  | `pullTab` | Pull something out: the SET button, to open an air gap and cut power, or a battery tab, which may connect the battery. |
  | `wait` | Wait, for `seconds` or until `expect` happens. |
  | `send` | Send the Insteon `command` the step names, by its Insteon Developer's Guide name. |
  | `other` | Anything else, such as choosing a button or removing a cover. |

- Linking with the SET button is written for the device alone: two devices link when one goes
  into linking mode and then the other, and the first becomes the controller.
- Linking and removal can have an alternative described as From a Hub, for adding the product
  to a Hub, or to a modem, and removing it. Its Hub or modem steps are `send` steps: on the
  `other` device for the Hub's own commands, such as Start ALL-Linking, and on `this` device for
  the commands the Hub sends the product, such as Enter Linking Mode or Ping. Steps a person
  takes on the product keep their own actions. A line-powered product is linked as a responder to
  the Hub, so the Hub can control it, and, where its profile lists a group it controls, from that
  group back to the Hub, so the Hub hears it; a battery-powered product is put in linking mode
  first and links to the Hub as a controller. Where its profile says how to keep it awake, the
  steps do so: before linking mode for some products, such as the Wireless Zone Thermostat
  2441ZTH, and right after the Hub starts ALL-Linking for others, such as the Open/Close Sensor
  2843 and the Leak Sensor 2852, which the Hub keeps awake with extended Set. No document
  describes these procedures, so their `verification` says what each is assembled from.
- `linkingTimeoutSeconds` is how long linking mode lasts, `awakeSeconds` how long a woken
  battery device stays awake, and `resetErases` what a factory reset clears.

## Command sets

Many products share the same settings, so the catalog describes them once, as command sets, and
a profile's `commandSets` entries name the one each identity uses:

```json
"commandSets": [{ "commandSet": "switchLincDimmer", "category": "0x01", "subcategory": "0x20" }]
```

Like an engine entry, a command set entry can carry a `firmware` selection when only some
versions use it. A command set is organized by Insteon's own message types:

- **Operating flags**: bits of the reply to Get Operating Flags (cmd1 `0x1F`), each with the
  `query` that cmd2 asks for and the `bit` that holds it, and the Set Operating Flags (cmd1
  `0x20`) cmd2 values `on` and `off` that set it to 1 and 0. `readings` are queries whose whole
  reply is a value, such as the ALL-Link database's delta, and `flagCommands` are Set Operating
  Flags values with no documented bit to read back.
- **Extended settings**: the `values` in the reply to an extended Get (cmd1 `0x2E`, D2 `0x00`),
  which arrives with `0x01` in D2, each at a `byte` from D3 to D14, and the `writes` that set
  them: an extended Set with the write's `selector` in D2 and its `bytes` from D3. When
  `perButton` is true, D1 chooses the button or group; otherwise D1 is `0x01`.
- **Standard commands**: other standard direct commands, each a `command1` with a fixed
  `command2`, a `parameter` the caller puts in cmd2, or neither for `0x00`. A `reply` is the
  value the acknowledgment carries in cmd2, and `followUp` the value one more direct message
  with the same cmd1 may carry, when the device has it. While the operating flag `extendedWhen`
  names is set, the command goes as an extended message with cmd1 and cmd2 again in D1 and D2
  and the other user data bytes `0x00`. Operating flags and flag commands can carry
  `extendedWhen` too.
- **Extended commands**: other extended direct commands, such as a Get with a cmd2 other than
  `0x00`. Each gives its `command1` and `command2`, its `fixed` user data bytes, the
  `parameters` the caller fills in, its `integrity`, and the extended `reply` that answers it,
  which its `match` bytes tell apart, with the `values` it carries.
- **Direct messages**: standard direct messages the device sends on its own, such as a
  thermostat's reports, each a `command1` with a `value` in cmd2.
- **Notes** on where Insteon's documents disagree, and the `sources` the values come from.

ALL-Link broadcasts aren't in command sets: a profile's `groupEvents` capability says what each
group's commands mean.

A value in a message names where it is: cmd2 in a standard message, or the user data `byte`, or
`bytes` most significant first, in an extended one. Its `mask`, if any, picks out its bits, and
it reads as:

| `kind` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `number` (the default) | A number, two's complement if `signed`, times `scale`, in `unit` |
| `buttons` | One bit per button, button 1 in bit 0 |
| `enumeration` | A name from the command set's `enumerations` entry that `enumeration` names |
| `flags` | The named `bits` |
| `boolean` | True when nonzero |

A `range` gives the values a parameter can take, in its unit. The unit `displayDegrees` means
degrees in the scale the device displays: the command set's `displayScale` names the flag,
value or bit that is true when it displays Celsius. Without one, or before it's been read,
they're Fahrenheit.

`integrity` says how an extended message's user data is protected: `none`, a `checksum` in D14
(the two's complement of the sum of cmd1, cmd2 and D1 through D13), or a `crc`, a 16-bit CRC
over cmd1, cmd2 and D1 through D12, with its high byte in D13 and its low byte in D14. Without
`integrity`, it's `none`.

For example, the reply to Get Operating Flags with cmd2 `0x00` from a device using
`switchLincDimmer` has bit `0x20` set when its key beep is on, and Set Operating Flags with cmd2
`0x0B` turns the beep off. An i2CS device expects these as extended messages with a checksum in
D14.

And a TempLinc Thermostat, which uses `tempLinc`, reports a new temperature with a direct
message whose cmd1 is `0x6E` and whose cmd2 is the temperature in half degrees of the scale it
displays. Its `readStatus` extended command asks for its status, and the reply carries the
temperature in D9 and D10, in tenths of a degree Celsius whatever the display shows.

## Settings pages and device controls

A device is addressed by its Insteon ID, but most of what an app shows belongs to one of its
groups: a FanLinc's light and fan, a dual outlet's top and bottom outlets, a keypad's buttons.
The catalog says what each group is and how to show each setting, so an app can build its pages
from the catalog alone.

**Group types.** A command set's `groupTypes` say what its groups can be, and each profile group
names one in `type`, which every command set its identities use must have:

```json
"groupTypes": [
  { "name": "light", "label": "Light", "kind": "dimmer",
    "state": { "command": "readStatus" },
    "actions": [
      { "name": "on", "label": "On", "command": "lightOn" },
      { "name": "off", "label": "Off", "command": "lightOff" } ] },
  { "name": "fan", "label": "Fan", "kind": "fan",
    "state": { "command": "readFanSpeed", "ranges": [
      { "from": "0x00", "through": "0x00", "label": "Off" },
      { "from": "0x01", "through": "0x7F", "label": "Low" },
      { "from": "0x80", "through": "0xFE", "label": "Medium" },
      { "from": "0xFF", "through": "0xFF", "label": "High" } ] },
    "actions": [
      { "name": "off", "label": "Off", "command": "fanOff" },
      { "name": "low", "label": "Low", "command": "fanLow" },
      { "name": "medium", "label": "Medium", "command": "fanMedium" },
      { "name": "high", "label": "High", "command": "fanHigh" } ] }
]
```

```json
"groups": [
  { "number": "0x01", "name": "Light", "role": "both", "type": "light" },
  { "number": "0x02", "name": "Fan", "role": "responder", "type": "fan" }
]
```

- `kind` is `dimmer`, `relay`, `fan`, `sensor` or `button`.
- `state` names the standard command whose acknowledgment carries the group's state in cmd2.
  With `bitPerGroup`, the reply holds one bit per group, group 1 in bit 0, as a keypad's LEDs or
  a dual outlet's outlets do; `ranges` name ranges of the value, such as a fan's speeds.
- `actions` are what an app can tell the group to do, for controls, scenes and schedules. Each
  names a standard or extended command and, when the command takes a parameter, either a fixed
  `value` (`0xFF` to switch a relay on) or nothing, for the caller to give, such as a dimmer's
  level. An action with `schedulable` false stays out of schedules.
- Only a responder can be told to do something, so a group whose type has actions has the role
  `responder` or `both`. A controller-only group, such as a sensor's, has no actions; it's
  something an app watches for, through the profile's `groupEvents`.
- A group with `activeWhen` is in use only while that operating flag is `set` or clear: a
  keypad's detached load, group 9, while `detachedLoad` is set, and its group 1 while it's clear.

**ALL-Link record data.** A group type's `linkData` says what Data 1 to 3 hold in the ALL-Link
database records for the group, so an app adding it to a scene writes the right bytes:

```json
"linkData": { "responder": [
  { "byte": 1, "name": "onLevel", "label": "On-level", "description": "The level the load goes to.",
    "unit": "percent", "scale": 0.392157, "range": { "from": "0x00", "through": "0xFF" } },
  { "byte": 2, "name": "rampRate", "label": "Ramp rate", "description": "How fast it gets there.",
    "table": "rampRate" },
  { "byte": 3, "name": "button", "label": "Button", "description": "The button the record is for.",
    "perGroup": true } ] }
```

- `responder` describes the record in the responder: the state the group goes to when its
  controller's group command arrives. `controller` describes the controller's record, where a
  product documents one; otherwise its data bytes don't matter.
- Each byte carries a `range`, a `unit` and `scale` or a `table`, as settings do, a fixed `value`
  to write, or `perGroup`. With `perGroup`, the byte is the responder's own group: the button or
  part of the device the record is for, as the profile numbers it. It isn't the record's Group
  field, which holds the controller's group.
- Relays and button LEDs use the `onOff` table: `0x00` off, `0xFF` on.
- A byte a list leaves out has no documented use for the group; write `0x00`.
- A device linked with its SET button keeps its present state as the record's data, so a light
  should be at the level wanted when it's linked.

A modem writes records of its own when it links, and its profile's `modem` capability can say
what their Data 1 to 3 hold, in `linkData`, so an app that writes such a record by hand writes
the same bytes:

```json
{ "kind": "modem", "linkData": { "controller": [
  { "byte": 1, "name": "data1", "description": "Always 0x01 in the records seen.", "value": "0x01" },
  { "byte": 2, "name": "subcategory", "description": "The responder's subcategory.", "identity": "subcategory" },
  { "byte": 3, "name": "firmware", "description": "The responder's firmware version.", "identity": "firmware" } ] } }
```

- `controller` is for the records in which the modem is the controller, and `responder` for
  those in which it's the responder.
- Each byte gives either a fixed `value` or the `identity` byte it copies: the linked device's
  `category`, `subcategory` or `firmware`, as ALL-Linking Completed reports them.
- A byte a list leaves out isn't known.

**Settings.** Operating flags, readings and extended settings values can carry:

- `label`: what to call the setting, such as "Beep on button press".
- `section`: the heading to show it under, one of Load, Relay, Sensor, Buttons, LEDs, Night,
  Timer, Alarm, Display, Battery, Linking, Communication, X10 and Diagnostics, in that order.
- `advanced`: true for a setting to keep out of sight unless asked, such as the powerline's
  timing or X10.
- `default`: the value as the device leaves the factory, where a document gives it: true or
  false for a flag, a byte for a value.
- For a value, `unit` and `scale` to show it as a number, such as an on-level as a percentage,
  or `table`, the command set's `valueTables` entry that names each raw value, such as the ramp
  rate's durations. A table can carry a `verification` like any other value.

The control follows from the setting:

- A flag with both `on` and `off` is a switch. A flag set by standard commands instead names them
  in `onCommand` and `offCommand`, such as the i3 products' night mode. A flag with only one of
  them can be set only that way, such as the Siren's disarmed flag, which the arm command clears.
  Any other flag, and every reading, is read-only.
- A value with a `table` is a picker, a `buttons` value is a choice of buttons, and a value with a
  `range` is a slider or stepper. A value is writable when an extended settings write sets it, or
  when it names the extended command that does in `write`; otherwise it's read-only.
- A value is per group when the write that sets it is `perButton`; everything else is the whole
  device's.

**Flags an app must guard.** Some operating flags can cut a device off or lock it, so their
`guard` says how a write treats them:

- `keep`: a write leaves the bit as it was read. Radio off, powerline off and checksum required
  have it.
- `neverSet`: a write may clear the bit but never sets it. The programming lock has it.

Some extended settings values are the same byte as an operating flags reply, such as the
Open/Close Sensor's `configuration` and the Hidden Door Sensor's `operatingFlags`. Such a value's
`flagsQuery` names the Get Operating Flags query (cmd2) whose reply it is, `0x00` for both, and
the command set's operating flags with that query name its bits. Before writing the value, an
app reads it, and refuses a write that would change a `keep` bit or set a `neverSet` one.

## Keeping a copy up to date

1. Fetch `manifest.json`.
2. If its `version` isn't one the client understands, keep the copy it has: below 1.0, one
   with the same MAJOR.MINOR as the client was built for; from 1.0, the same MAJOR.
3. If its `sha256` matches the copy the client has, stop: nothing changed.
4. Otherwise fetch `catalog.json`, check that its bytes hash to `sha256`, and only then replace
   the copy.

Ship a copy with the software, so it works offline and fetching is optional.

## Looking a device up

1. Ask the device to identify itself. Its reply carries its category, subcategory and firmware
   version.
2. Find the profile with an identity whose `category` and `subcategory` match and whose
   `firmware` range, if it has one, includes the firmware version. The build makes sure no two
   identities overlap, so there's at most one.
3. With no match, fall back on what the category alone implies, such as dimming for category
   `0x01` and switching for `0x02`.

Example: a device replies with category `0x10`, subcategory `0x08`. That's the 2852 Leak
Sensor above, so an ALL-Link broadcast from it with cmd1 `0x11` to group `0x02` means `wet`, and
not hearing from it for longer than its 1428-minute heartbeat interval means it may have stopped
working.

## Versions

The catalog follows semantic versioning, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, and the path names its MAJOR version:
`v0` now, `v1` once the format is final. The manifest carries the version and when the catalog
was built; the catalog itself doesn't, so its SHA-256 changes only when its data does.

- PATCH: the data changed but not the format, such as a new profile or a corrected value. The
  publishing workflow counts it: the commits since `VERSION` last changed that changed
  `devices/` or `commandSets/`.
- MINOR: the format changed, in the schemas or in the files' layout. From 1.0, only by adding
  optional fields a client can ignore.
- MAJOR: from 1.0, a change that would break a client built for the earlier format. It will be
  published under a new path, with the earlier MAJOR's files kept beside it.

Below 1.0 the format can still change in any MINOR, so a client should only take a catalog with
the MAJOR.MINOR it was built for. `VERSION` in the repository holds MAJOR.MINOR; the build fails
a pull request that changes the schemas without raising it, or that lowers it. A change to the
files' layout in `scripts/build.py` must raise it too.
